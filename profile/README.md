### 🧠 About Us  
We are a research group in **Machine Learning and Robotics**, exploring how intelligent systems can learn, plan, and adapt through language, perception, and interaction.  
Our mission is to build **embodied AI agents** capable of reasoning and acting in dynamic environments through multimodal understanding and reinforcement learning.

---

### 🔬 Research Directions  

- **LLM-driven Reward Design** — using large language models to shape and explain RL rewards, enabling systems to adapt to faults and dynamic environmental changes  
- **Multi-Agent LLM Systems** — enabling cooperation, communication, and planning among autonomous agents  
- **Language-Conditioned Robot Policies** — grounding robot control in natural language instructions  
- **Spatial Intelligence in VLMs/LLMs** — improving spatial reasoning and perception for embodied tasks  
- **LLM-based Planning & Skill Composition** — integrating symbolic and learned reasoning through skill libraries  

---

### 🧩 Ongoing Focus  

> Combining **LLMs/VLMs/VLAs** with **RL** and **Skill Libraries** to advance adaptive, generalizable robotic intelligence.  

Our work bridges:  
- **Perception** → understanding visual and spatial cues  
- **Language** → interpreting and reasoning with instructions  
- **Action** → executing precise robotic control and planning
